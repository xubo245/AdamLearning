1. art：

```
	
	art_illumina -ss HS20 -i GRCH38BWAindex/GRCH38chr1L3556522.fna -p -l 100 -m 200 -s 10  -c 10000000 -o g38L100c10000000Nhs20Paired

```


2.fastq上传到hdfs

```

	spark-submit  --class cs.ucla.edu.bwaspark.BWAMEMSpark --master spark://219.219.220.149:7077  /home/hadoop/xubo/tools/cloud-scale-bwamem-0.2.1/target/cloud-scale-bwamem-0.2.0-assembly.jar upload-fastq   1 21 g38L100c10000000Nhs20Paired1.fq g38L100c10000000Nhs20Paired2.fq /xubo/data/alignment/cs-bwamem/fastq/g38L100c10000000Nhs20Paired12.fastq

```


3.配置：
需要将fasta dispatch到各个节点，每个节点需要有cs-bwamem的jar包，jni搞全局路径

4.align：

```

 	spark-submit --executor-memory 4g --class cs.ucla.edu.bwaspark.BWAMEMSpark --total-executor-cores 20 --master spark://219.219.220.149:7077  --conf spark.driver.host=219.219.220.149 --conf spark.driver.cores=4 --conf spark.driver.maxResultSize=4g --conf spark.storage.memoryFraction=0.7  --conf spark.akka.threads=2 --conf spark.akka.frameSize=1024 /home/hadoop/xubo/tools/cloud-scale-bwamem-0.2.1/target/cloud-scale-bwamem-0.2.0-assembly.jar cs-bwamem -bfn 1 -bPSW 1 -sbatch 10 -bPSWJNI 1  -oChoice 2 -oPath hdfs://219.219.220.149:9000/xubo/data/alignment/cs-bwamem/fastq/g38L100c10000000Nhs20Paired12F2.adam -localRef 1 -jniPath /home/hadoop/xubo/tools/cloud-scale-bwamem-0.2.1/target/jniNative.so -isSWExtBatched 1  1 /home/hadoop/cloud/adam/xubo/data/GRCH38Sub/cs-bwamem/GRCH38BWAindex/GRCH38chr1L3556522.fasta  /xubo/data/alignment/cs-bwamem/fastq/g38L100c10000000Nhs20Paired12.fastq
```

5.merge：

	spark-submit --executor-memory 6g --class cs.ucla.edu.bwaspark.BWAMEMSpark --total-executor-cores 20 --master spark://219.219.220.149:7077  --conf spark.driver.host=219.219.220.149 --conf spark.driver.cores=4 --conf spark.driver.maxResultSize=6g --conf spark.storage.memoryFraction=0.7  --conf spark.akka.threads=2 --conf spark.akka.frameSize=1024 /home/hadoop/xubo/tools/cloud-scale-bwamem-0.2.1/target/cloud-scale-bwamem-0.2.0-assembly.jar merge hdfs://219.219.220.149:9000 /xubo/data/alignment/cs-bwamem/fastq/g38L100c10000000Nhs20Paired12F2.adam /xubo/data/alignment/cs-bwamem/fastq/g38L100c10000000Nhs20Paired12F2.merge.adam


6.统计：

```

	package org.bdgenomics.avocado.cli
	
	import org.apache.spark.sql.SQLContext
	import org.apache.spark.{SparkConf, SparkContext}
	
	/**
	  * Created by xubo on 2016/5/27.
	  * 从hdfs下载经过avocado匹配好的数据
	  * run:success
	  */
	object parquetRead2csbwamemDup {
	  def main(args: Array[String]) {
	    val conf = new SparkConf().setMaster("local[4]").setAppName(this.getClass().getSimpleName().filter(!_.equals('$')))
	    val sc = new SparkContext(conf)
	    val sqlContext = new SQLContext(sc)
	    println("start:")
	    //    val file = "hdfs://219.219.220.149:9000/xubo/16.adam/0"
	    //    val file = "hdfs://219.219.220.149:9000/xubo/data/alignment/cs-bwamem/fastq/g38L100c10000000Nhs20.merge.adam/"
	    val file = "hdfs://219.219.220.149:9000/xubo/data/alignment/cs-bwamem/fastq/g38L100c10000000Nhs20Paired12F2.merge.adam/"
	
	
	    val df3 = sqlContext.read.option("mergeSchema", "true").parquet(file)
	    //    df3.printSchema()
	    df3.show()
	    println(df3.count())
	    var j = 1
	    //    for (i <- df3) {
	    //      println(j + ":" + i)
	    //      j += 1
	    //    }
	    //    println("distinct:" + df3.distinct.count())
	    sc.stop
	    println("end")
	  }
	}

```

结果：

```

	scala>     println(df3.count())
	18512773
	scala> println("distinct:" + df3.distinct.count())
	distinct:18512773   
```
